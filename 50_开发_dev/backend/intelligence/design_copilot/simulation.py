"""SimulationLab — STRUCTURE_ONLY.

Encodes the same "simulated data cannot self-certify" guardrail as
`domains/product_intelligence/domain/entities.py` `GrowthHypothesis.mark_validated`
(the sole canonical Product Intelligence domain per the chief-architect
PR-001R ruling on PR #27 — `domains/product_strategy` was removed, not just
this module's docstring reference to it), deliberately duplicated here
rather than sharing one gate function. Two independent enforcement points
mean a bug in one doesn't silently let simulated evidence through the other
— see `CLAUDE.md` section 4 and
`architecture/FAMILY_PRODUCT_INTELLIGENCE_PLATFORM_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE_DRAFT_001.md`
§2.

This class has no real synthetic-family model — `run()` is not implemented.
It exists to fix the guardrail's shape in code before any simulation content
is built, per the project-owner-approved compromise (structure first,
guessed parameters never).
