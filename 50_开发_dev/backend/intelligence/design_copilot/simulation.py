"""SimulationLab — STRUCTURE_ONLY.

Encodes the same "simulated data cannot self-certify" guardrail as
`domains/product_strategy/domain/entities.py` `Opportunity.promote_to_invest`,
deliberately duplicated here rather than sharing one gate function. Two
independent enforcement points mean a bug in one doesn't silently let
simulated evidence through the other — see `CLAUDE.md` section 4 and
`architecture/FAMILY_PRODUCT_INTELLIGENCE_PLATFORM_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE_DRAFT_001.md`
§2.

This class has no real synthetic-family model — `run()` is not implemented.
It exists to fix the guardrail's shape in code before any simulation content
is built, per the project-owner-approved compromise (structure first,
guessed parameters never).
