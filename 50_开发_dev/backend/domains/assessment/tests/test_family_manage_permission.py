"""Tests for the RBAC half of `assert_tenant_family_scope` — the port of
`assertFamilyManagePermission` (`apps/api/src/modules/family/family-permission.ts`)
that was previously a tracked-but-unported gap in `SqlAlchemyAssessmentRepository`
(and, symmetrically, in `FakeAssessmentRepository`).

Exercises both pass conditions from the NestJS source, independently:
  1. legacy `CreateFamily` audit success for (family_id, actor_id)
  2. an ACTIVE `OWNER_GUARDIAN`/`GUARDIAN` family_membership for actor_id
and the reject path when neither holds.
