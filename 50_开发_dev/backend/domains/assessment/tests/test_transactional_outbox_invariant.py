"""Verifies the Transactional Outbox invariant for the Assessment domain
against a REAL PostgreSQL instance — see
`50_开发_dev/backend/domains/assessment/OUTBOX_VERIFICATION_NOTES.md` for the
full write-up of method and conclusion.

This is deliberately a SEPARATE file from
`test_sqlalchemy_repository_integration.py` (not just more asserts bolted
onto it) because the two ask different questions:

  * `test_sqlalchemy_repository_integration.py` asks "does a normal command
    call produce the rows we expect?" (happy path).
  * This file asks the actual Transactional Outbox question: "if the outbox
    write step raises partway through, does EVERYTHING in that command call
    roll back — business state AND audit AND outbox — leaving zero
    observable side effects?" That is the property the pattern exists to
    guarantee (business state change and event emission are atomic), and it
    can only be demonstrated by forcing a failure inside the transaction and
    then querying the database from a SEPARATE connection to see what
    persisted, not by reading source code.

Requires `PY_ASSESSMENT_TEST_DATABASE_URL` — same env var and skip behavior
as the sibling integration test file.
