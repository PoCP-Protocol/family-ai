"""Integration test for `SqlAlchemyAiRunLedger` against a REAL PostgreSQL
instance — verifies `record()` actually writes a row to `ai_run_ledger`
(`database/migrations/0045_ai_run_ledger.sql`), not just that the in-memory
`FakeAiRunLedger` records calls correctly (already covered in
`test_ai_run_ledger.py`).

Requires `PY_ASSESSMENT_TEST_DATABASE_URL` env var pointing at a disposable
PostgreSQL database that already has the schema from
`database/migrations/0001..0045` applied — same convention as
`test_sqlalchemy_repository_integration.py`. Skipped entirely if that env
var is not set.
