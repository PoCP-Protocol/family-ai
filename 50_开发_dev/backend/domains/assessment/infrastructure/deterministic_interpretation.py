"""Default (mock/fail-closed) interpretation adapter — port of the
`interpretDeterministically` fallback path in `family-model`'s
`FamilyEducationModelRuntime`. Per G1-A's binding default
(`governance/AUTHORIZATION_REGISTRY.yaml`, `.env.example` mock/fail-closed),
this is what runs when no live provider is configured: deterministic,
rule-based, no external call. A real `AiRuntimeInterpretationAdapter` that
calls the Python AI Runtime process is a later step in this task — the
migration plan's own acceptance criterion #9 ("provider failure fails
closed, explicitly") means this fallback path must exist and be correct
before a live path is added, not after.

Boundary labels (`hypothesis_not_fact`, `recommendation_not_decision`,
`signal_not_diagnosis`) and the construct-ref whitelist rule are the same
fail-closed guarantees `assertInterpretationBoundary` enforces in the
TypeScript version — see migration plan section 10.

AI Run Ledger: an optional `AiRunLedgerPort` may be injected (constructor
arg, defaulted to `None` for backward compatibility with existing call
sites). When present, every `interpret()` call — including this fallback
path with no external call — writes one `AiRunRecord` with
`generator="deterministic"`, so the ledger can distinguish "this session's
draft came from the rule-based fallback" from "this session's draft came
from the live model", which is exactly the audit gap migration plan §9's
"AI Run Ledger" item exists to close. See `domain/ai_run.py`.
