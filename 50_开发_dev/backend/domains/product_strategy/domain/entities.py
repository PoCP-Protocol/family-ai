"""Product Strategy domain entities.

No TS predecessor — new domain, schema authored directly against
`architecture/FAMILY_PRODUCT_INTELLIGENCE_PLATFORM_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE_DRAFT_001.md`
§4, restated here as behaviour-bearing entities (the `packages/contracts`
versions are plain data schemas with no methods).

This module has no FastAPI / SQLAlchemy / provider-SDK dependency, per the
four-layer rule in `architecture/FAMILY_AI_PYTHON_ONLY_MIGRATION_PLAN_V1.md`
section 3.
