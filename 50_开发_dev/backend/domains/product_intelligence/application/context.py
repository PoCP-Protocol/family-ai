"""ActorContext — the only source of `created_by`/`tenant_scope`/actor
identity for this domain (PR-001R, chief-architect review on PR #27, item
3: "客户端不能决定自己是谁,也不能决定自己属于哪个 tenant"). Request DTOs no
longer carry `created_by`/`tenant_scope`/`human_actor` fields; every
application-service command takes a `ActorContext` supplied by the API
layer's authentication dependency (`api/dependencies.py`), never by the
request body.

This PR does not implement real authentication — no JWT/session verification
exists yet. `api/dependencies.py::get_actor_context` fails closed
(`RuntimeError`) until a real auth mechanism is wired in by whichever PR
adds `apps/family_api`. Tests construct `ActorContext` directly, which is
legitimate for unit/integration tests but must never become how a real
request obtains one.
