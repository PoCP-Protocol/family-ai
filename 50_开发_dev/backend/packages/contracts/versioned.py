"""Immutable versioned-object base pattern.

No TS predecessor for this exact shape — the closest analogue is the TS
`ServiceBlueprintVersion` concept referenced in
`architecture/FAMILY_PRODUCT_INTELLIGENCE_PLATFORM_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE_DRAFT_001.md`
§4, but that type has no real implementation on either side (TS or Python)
as of this skeleton — see the DRAFT doc's exploration notes. This base class
is written directly against the DRAFT doc, not ported from existing code.

Any future real `ServiceBlueprintVersion` (Python-side) should extend this
base rather than re-invent version/status handling.
