"""Evidence/provenance vocabulary shared by the product-strategy skeleton
domains.

Aligned with (not duplicating) the evidence-tier vocabulary and gating logic
in `20_知识_knowledge/byresearch/evidence.py` (the single implementation of
record E0-E7 rules per `CLAUDE.md` section 4 — "证据等级刻度与门禁的唯一实现").
This module only re-declares the tier *names* as a type, plus the two extra
tiers this platform needs (`simulated`, `inferred`) that are already named in
`CLAUDE.md` section 4 ("溯源为 simulated/inferred/unverified/unknown 的...不可用于
支撑'成立'"). It must never re-implement the gating rules themselves.
