"""Product Learning schemas — STRUCTURE_ONLY.

`ProductHealthScore` dimensions are all `float | None` with no default
weighting — per the project-owner-approved compromise, no guessed parameter
is allowed to ship in this skeleton. Filling these in requires real
post-publish family usage data, not invented weights.
