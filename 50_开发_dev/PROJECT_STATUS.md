## Known Issues

- last_completed_task: M2_WAVE3_FINAL_ARCHITECT_SIGNOFF_AND_CLOSURE
- current_gate_blocker: none for Wave3; next step is a separate M3 / Famili Principal Intelligence Architecture & Contract Gate.
- Wave3 browser F10/F11 gate passed in a continuous fresh real API UI flow; current web app still does not hydrate the full journey after reload, so reload-based proof must not be counted as browser evidence.
- Contract Freeze is now immutable baseline `M2_WAVE2_CF_V1`; changes require `CONTRACT_CHANGE_REQUEST` and AI-00 approval before any V2.
- Existing unrelated/unintegrated worktree files must not be reverted during Wave 2 integration.
- `growth_journeys.subject_person_id` must not be added for convenience; subject/consent resolution must converge through canonical relations or a minimal `GrowthSubjectResolver`.
- `growth_actions` legacy dual-write is temporary schema compatibility only and requires audit before Real PostgreSQL final gate.

## Not Started

- 90-Day Journey implementation
- AI Model Gateway
- Agent Runtime
- Knowledge Foundry
- Causal Platform
- World Model

## Explicitly Deferred

- Full 0–18 LifeStage coverage
- Child autonomous agent
- Community marketplace
- City ecosystem
- Family Total Score
- Family ranking
- Reinforcement learning
- World Model training
- M2 Wave4 Intelligence: M2_WAVE4_INTELLIGENCE = SUPERSEDED_FOR_EXECUTION_BY_CCR; NEW_OWNER = M3-W1 Famili Principal Runtime; M2_REOPEN = NO

## Architecture Decisions

- Modular Monolith First
- PostgreSQL First
- TypeScript / NestJS preferred for backend
- React / TypeScript preferred for web
- OpenAPI-first API contract
- Named Action for core state mutation
- Event + Audit from Day 1
- Family Technical Architecture V3.2 Build-to-Operate Rebaseline
- One Consumer App, Ops Web, and isolated legacy surface
- ProductEvent / GrowthEvent / AuditEvent / OutboxEvent separation
- Principal AI proposes; humans confirm through Named Action
- Community participates; it does not define growth
- FELS is old world; FLM translates; Family is new world
- ARCHITECTURE_DRIVER = 35_UI_PRODUCT_SCOPE (2026-08-22 ruling; method = UI → Journey → Capability → Domain → Runtime; 35 UI = V1 Product Scope Baseline; ONE_UI_ONE_BACKEND=NO; SHARED_DOMAIN_MODEL=YES; UI_PROJECTION=YES; 7 domains + AI Control Plane + Family Growth Context; MOBILE = PRIMARY_CONSUMER_PRODUCT / Experience Runtime; see governance/ARCHITECTURE_DRIVER_35UI_REBASELINE_001.md; task = FAMILY-35UI-ARCHITECTURE-REBASELINE-001)

## Status Update Rule

每个完成Task的AI必须更新：

- Completed
- In Progress
- Known Issues
- Last completed task

但不得擅自改变milestone或phase。
